 I developed a one-dimensional simulation of quantum tunneling using Python using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical computations and data visualization. This project allowed me to explore the fascinating phenomenon of quantum mechanics, where particles can 'tunnel' through potential barriersâ€”a behavior that has no classical equivalent.
